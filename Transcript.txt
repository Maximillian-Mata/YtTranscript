Line: [Samantha] We choreograph and perform live
lightsaber duels so the kind of stuff you
Line: see in the Star Wars movies we go out and
we do that live. [Dashad] Well for me SOLD is just
Line: a great community to be a part of we get to
give back to the community. [Lily] As somebody who's
Line: in the entertainment technology and design
major here at UNLV, it's really helped me just
Line: kind of broaden my horizons as to what
I can do in the entertainment industries.
Line: [Logan] I can guarantee you that SOLD is what got me my
current job because when they see it on a resume
Line: they go all right I got know what is this? [Cameron] SOLD
really gives a lot of people a home who don't
Line: really feel like they fit in anywhere else. It's a
creative outlet. [Dashad] I don't think if I had joined SOLD
Line: I would have as many friends as I do and a place
of belonging while being here. 
Line: [Alison] Joining REB wasprobably one of the best things that I did on thiscampus -- we plan all the fun events on campus so
Line: Premier, Homecoming, and Late Night Breakfast
are some of our main ones. [Emily] I want to be an event
Line: manager so having REB and promoting things
like this where students just have fun it's
Line: really important to me and it's really important
to student life as well. 
Line: [Gorio] The UNLV Rowing team it'sa special team to my heart. The community that wehave is so great cause we get all together in that
Line: boat and it's just quiet. [Trinity] Rowing has helped me a
lot you realize I'm capable enough you know they
Line: might have a few more inches but I have the grit
and I have the willpower to want to get out there
Line: and to do my best. [Jillian] I have arthritis and rowing
has really helped calm all my joints and stuff
Line: along with my medications of course. [Coach Andersen] So our team is
kids that are going to school full-time, they all
Line: started brand new we teach everything about rowing
right from the get-go.
Line: [Rabih] SEDS actually stands for theStudents for the Exploration and Development ofSpace but we like to nickname it UNLV's rocket
Line: team 'cause we focus the rocket side of thing. [Zoe] There's
a lot of stuff that you get out of being in an
Line: engineering club that you're not going to get
in classes what it actually is being an engineer
Line: working on a team, you know, having a specific goal
like working on a project. It's a very welcoming
Line: environment and it's just a really really good
opportunity to learn a lot. [Gavin] I think the main reason
Line: we have a lot of fun though is because everyone
has a positive attitude and everybody just wants
Line: to get the job done. Having a team like that is I
think the concrete platform that you need in order
Line: to make a project like this. 
Line: [Myriam] Hi I'm Myriam andwe're here at project 150 packaging food to serveunderserved and homeless high school students
which are really in need of the food during this
Line: like developmental stage in their life. [Carolina] I think
it's definitely important because it's helping
Line: contribute to our community and helping make sure
that others get the education that we all deserve.
Line: If you know these students go out and help we're
helping them get to our position basically. [Marie] I do
Line: a lot of DASH events where we create like food
bags and everything and then give them out to the
Line: community. I would say that it's just really great
to be a part of the community and also just get
Line: more involvement with the school a great way to
also like meet friends and just you know just be
Line: involved with everything. [Victoria] As a pre-nursing major
I want to work here. [Cecily] I wanted to learn more about
Line: Vegas as a community and I think having volunteers
get out here and have something meaningful for
Line: themselves helps and in the like longer run like
you it can help you beneficially like with your
Line: mental health. [Lauren] I think it's important just to
make sure that everybody in your community is
Line: doing okay so that we could all thrive and
do more service together.
Line: [Mars] Spectrum creates a safe space for all students of the LGBTQIA+ community to just hang out find a sense
Line: of community and occasionally we do stuff for
Pride in October. [Kel] We really strive on having a fun
Line: and safe environment where you feel comfortable
just being yourself. 
Line: [L] I'd say Rebel D&D is a group of people that all share an interest in tabletop
RPGs that come together on a weekly basis to
Line: explore characters, stories, and just hang on have
a great time together. [Izzy] A lot of people think that
Line: university is just going to school and going to
classes and then going home but really there's a
Line: lot more to it. Being able to have a place to go
to where you can have friends where you can be
Line: yourself, you don't have to worry about fitting
in. You can roll dice and kill monsters. You canjust have a lot of fun. 
Line: [Warren] Yeah I would say it's great
to get involved at school it's a good way to meet
Line: new people, make friends. [Emily] I learn how passionate
I am about helping communities it's something
Line: I want to do as well in my career and also it's
helped me with getting leadership skills in order
Line: to take advantage of opportunities and just take
initiative into different ways. [Jason] It's really taught
Line: me a lot of discipline about being able to set
like a good schedule for myself being able 
Line: tomanage my time well. Being able to wake up early
now.
Line: [Nyx] With my sociology degree it kind of helped openmy eyes to where I could go out and help in theworld. 
Line: [Joel] Having this sort of community is something
Line: that really begins to make going to school here at
UNLV feel special, feel important. 
Line: [Jerome] Being a member of SEDS will prepare me, you know, in my future careeras an aerospace engineer I feel like SEDS will just
Line: make me more industry ready with all that said
come build a rocket with us at SEDS.
